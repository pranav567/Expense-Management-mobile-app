# Expense-Management-mobile-app

Mobile App to track expenses. Functionalites involve adding expense, setting up a profile which involves adding data about cards, e-wallets, bank accounts which can be used while adding an expense so that an individual can track each card separately and can plan ahead. I am using Expo which is a platform built on top of React Native and firebase firestore for database and authentication.
