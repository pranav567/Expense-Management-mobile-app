# Expense-Management-mobile-app
Mobile App to track expenses. Functionalites involve adding expense, setting up a profile which involves adding data about cards, e-wallets, bank accounts which can be used while adding an expense so that an individual can track each card separately and can plan ahead. I am using React Native with expo and firebase for database and authentication.
